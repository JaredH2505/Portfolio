            EcoSim is an economy engine for Unity game development. As games
            have increased in complexity, the development time required to
            complete them has increased significantly and requires that
            companies developing games decide which features to include in their
            games. Unfortunately, in-game economies are often one of the
            features that goes by the wayside. Realistic economies are pared
            down to simple models where trading exists only between the player
            and NPCs, prices are fixed, and supply is regenerated at fixed time
            intervals. This decision helps games stay on schedule, but it also
            detracts from the immersiveness of those games. EcoSim aims to
            change this. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as the introduction of physics engines in the
            early 2000s allowed game developers to incorporate high-quality
            physics simulations into their games, EcoSim aims to make it fast
            and easy for game developers to incorporate realistic economies into
            their games as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            EcoSim will be distributed as a Unity package
            that can be incorporated directly and easily into any Unity game.
            Once the package is installed, developers will be able to apply
            EcoSim scripts to game objects and configure the EcoSim engine to
            dial in the specifics of the economy they want to simulate in their
            game. This configuration will allow developers to specify everything
            from the prices of goods, cost of travel, and production rates to
            the roles and needs of the economic agents (NPCs) in their game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once configured, EcoSim will handle the specifics of running the
            in-game economy by managing the supply of goods, their prices, and
            the actions of economic agents that are producing, consuming,
            transporting, buying, and selling goods. Because EcoSim handles the
            specifics, developers using the EcoSim package will be able to
            include a realistic economy in their games without having to spend
            the time to develop the economic engine themselves, which will make
            their games more immersive and fun to play. ~ Team EcoSim
